# vite-plugin-virtual-mpa-demo

The full project is available at https://github.com/emosheeep/vite-plugin-virtual-mpa/tree/master/workspaces/example

Created with CodeSandbox. Since we have no control over which page is opened, we set base to '/' so that we can see the content when we enter the page. You can customize the vite config to reach whatever you want.

Click the link within the container's page and check the log from console for a development preview. Also you can open in a new tab for a further experience because it seems like the actual url won't sync with container's url.

You can click '+' in the top right corner of the console to open an operable terminal, and then excute `yarn build` to build resource into `dist`.

Have a gooooood time!
